ABSTRACT

The main aim of this project is to develop a Real-Time Cardiac Monitoring Device. To be able to detect basic Cardiac related diseases. Cardiac patients can be regularly monitored using low-cost sensor networks which can save many lives and valuable time of experts. The detection of the heart related diseases for Example: Cardiac Arrest, Tachycardia, high and low BP, etc. To construct this system at a reasonable price and easy to use. The device can be used to help the concerned person or specialist at a distance to monitor and act on the patientâ€™s condition.
Wearable sensors for health monitoring can enable the early detection of various symptoms, and hence rapid remedial actions may be undertaken. In particular, the monitoring of cardiac events by using such wearable sensors can provide real- time and more relevant diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias than classical solutions.
ECG monitors with features such as portable/wearable, wireless, use-friendly, low-cost and convenient at home, are more and more necessary. electrocardiogram (ECG) signals monitoring, a process in which battery-operated wearable sensors collect long-term recording of ECG signals.
Healthcare Internet of Things (HIoT) can connect mobile and wearable devices in the medical field, making disease monitoring and diagnosis possible anytime and anywhere. Most of these mobile and wearable devices can collect physiological signals of the human body in real time. This research focuses on designing and developing a method for predicting arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation) along with monitoring the ECG signals. To create an arrhythmia prediction model and an Android-based real-time ECG surveillance system.
